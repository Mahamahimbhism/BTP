                <h3>Finger Tapping Test</h3>
                <p>The Finger Tapping Test is a simple yet effective neuropsychological assessment used to measure motor speed and fine motor control. In this task, individuals are asked to tap a key or button as quickly as possible using a specific finger, usually over a set period like 10 seconds. The number of taps is recorded and analyzed to evaluate motor function, coordination, and potential neurological issues. It is commonly used in clinical settings to assess conditions like Parkinson’s disease or brain injuries.</p>

                <h3>Go/No-Go Task</h3>
                <p>The Go/No-Go Task is a cognitive test designed to evaluate a person’s impulse control and attention. Participants are instructed to perform an action (e.g., press a button) when presented with certain stimuli (Go signals) and to withhold the action when different stimuli appear (No-Go signals). This task helps in understanding how well an individual can regulate their responses, making it especially useful in research on ADHD, executive functioning, and frontal lobe activity.</p>

                <h3>Psycho-Motor Vigilance Task (PVT)</h3>
                <p>The Psycho-Motor Vigilance Task (PVT) is a widely used reaction time test that assesses sustained attention and alertness. Participants are required to respond as quickly as possible to visual stimuli that appear at random intervals on a screen. The PVT is sensitive to the effects of sleep deprivation, fatigue, and circadian rhythm changes, making it a standard tool in sleep research and occupational health studies.</p>

                <h3>Trail Making Test</h3>
                <p>The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological assessment used to measure visual attention, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility. It consists of two parts: in Part A, individuals connect numbered circles in sequence, while in Part B, they alternate between numbers and letters (e.g., 1-A-2-B). The time taken to complete each part is recorded, with longer times potentially indicating cognitive impairment. It is often used in clinical evaluations for brain injury, dementia, and executive dysfunction.</p>

                <h3>N-Back Paradigm</h3>
                <p>The N-Back Task is a continuous performance task used to assess working memory and cognitive control. Participants view a sequence of stimuli and must indicate when the current stimulus matches one presented N items ago (e.g., 2-back or 3-back). This task measures the ability to monitor, update, and manipulate information in working memory, making it valuable for studying executive functions and attention.</p>

                <h3>Stroop Color-Word Test</h3>
                <p>The Stroop Test measures selective attention, processing speed, and cognitive control. Participants are shown color words printed in incongruent ink colors (e.g., the word "RED" printed in blue ink) and must name the ink color while ignoring the word's meaning. This creates interference, as reading is more automatic than color naming. The test is widely used to assess executive functions, inhibitory control, and frontal lobe function.</p>

                <h3>Eriksen Flanker Task</h3>
                <p>The Flanker Task assesses selective attention and the ability to suppress irrelevant information. Participants respond to a central target stimulus (e.g., an arrow) while ignoring flanking distractors that may be congruent, incongruent, or neutral. The task measures response inhibition and conflict monitoring, with activation in the anterior cingulate cortex playing a key role in resolving conflicts between competing responses.</p>

                <h3>Posner Cueing Task</h3>
                <p>The Posner Cueing Task is a classic paradigm for studying spatial attention and attentional orienting. A cue appears before a target, either validly predicting the target location (same side) or invalidly (opposite side). Reaction times are faster for valid cues, demonstrating the benefits of attentional pre-orienting. This task is fundamental for understanding how attention shifts in space and the mechanisms of visual attention.</p>
